From a design perspective, it hasn’t changed too much; I like to think that it’s a bit more refined, but the same general idea. Most of the interesting changes are under-the-hood, or hidden in the details. In this blog post, I want to share what the new stack looks like, and dig into some of those details!

Over the years, my blog has become a surprisingly complex application. It’s over 100,000 lines of code, not counting the content. Migrating everything over was a big project, but super educational. I’ll share my honest thoughts on all of the new technology I used for this blog.

If you’re planning on starting a blog yourself, or are thinking about using some of the technologies I’m using, this post will hopefully be quite helpful!

This is a list in markdown:
 
- One
- Two
- Three
 
Checkout my React component:

```ts
console.log('Not focused');
console.log('Focused') // [!code focus]
console.log('Not focused');
```


```jsx copy="true" filename="index.js"
import { MyComponent } from 'app/components/MyComponent';
<MyComponent />
```

```ts
console.log('hewwo') // [!code --]
```
 
This is a code block in markdown:

```tsx
"use client"

import { Check, Copy } from "lucide-react"
import { useRef, useState } from "react"
// [!code highlight:3]
const CopyToClipboard = ({ code }: { code: string }) => {
  const copyRef = useRef<NodeJS.Timeout>(null)
  const [isCopied, setIsCopied] = useState(false)

  console.log('hewwo') // [!code --]
  console.log('hello') // [!code ++]

  const handleCopy = () => {
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(code)
    setIsCopied(true) 
    copyRef.current = setTimeout(() => { // [!code --]
      setIsCopied(false)
      if (copyRef.current) {
        clearTimeout(copyRef.current)
      }
      copyRef.current = null
    }, 1000)
  }

  return (
    <button
      onClick={handleCopy}
      className="absolute top-1 right-1 cursor-pointer rounded-sm p-2 hover:bg-gray-800"
    >
      {isCopied ? (
        <Check className="text-green-500" size={14} /> // [!code highlight]
      ) : (
        <Copy size={14} />
      )}
    </button>
  )
}

export default CopyToClipboard

```
