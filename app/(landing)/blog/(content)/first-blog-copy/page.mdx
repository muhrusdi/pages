# Welcome to my MDX page!

This ability is crucial for the sorts of content I create. I didn't want to be limited by the standard set of Markdown elements (links, tables, lists…). With MDX, I can create my own elements! It feels so much more powerful than traditional Markdown, or rich-text content stored in a CMS.

You might be wondering: Why not go “full React”, and skip the Markdown part altogether? When I built the very first version of this blog, way back in 2017, that’s exactly what I did. Each blog post was a React component. There were two problems with this:
 
This is some **bold** and _italics_ text.
 
This is a list in markdown:
 
- One
- Two
- Three
 
Checkout my React component:

```jsx
import { MyComponent } from 'app/components/MyComponent';
<MyComponent />
```
